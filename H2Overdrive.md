# H2Overdrive: The successor to Hydro Thunder you didn't know of

Unless you heard of it from another Hydro Thunder fan, or have watched MrThunderwing's retrospective on the entire franchise.

Anyways, while I don't write big things about games as often as I used to, I have felt somewhat compelled to try doing at least a thing for this game due to the fact that, while I first revisited Hydro Thunder Hurricane and then tried this game for the first time, it wasn't until I went through the entirety of the original Hydro Thunder on PC and then came back to this with the new knowledge I had obtained where I started to click even more with this one.

Even if sometimes, in a few jank occasions, can feel more annoying. But as I'll get to those oddities later, it definitely lives up to this spiritual successor name this game has to Hydro Thunder.

Because it might as well be an official sequel with a different name.

Long story short, the game was developed by Specular Interactive, which was mainly composed of ex-Midway developers...so you can see that it was basically most of the original Hydro Thunder team behind this game, which explains the large similarity between both games, compared to Hurricane which was initially not a HT game and did focus on a different approach to certain things compared to the OG Hydro Thunder. Things that were instead stronger emphasized in this unofficial sequel.

One of those would be the Mighty Hull, the ability to ram boats off your way with boost. While in Hurricane this ability was removed, forcing you to be mindful of any other boats on the way as you can't just push them, H2Overdrive instead **grants you free boost** for each opponent you crash into. Although note that you'll still have to often plan your boost pickup routes, as each hit only grants you one second of boost.

Funnily enough, you can actually *juggle* boats and keep getting boost from them if they happen to get sent straight ahead and continues being struck by you. But enough of the Mighty Hull...for now.

#   The classic basics

If you aren't familiar with Hydro Thunder already, there are three key things you need to know and start learning if you want to win.

- Pick up boosters and use them
- Learn the track and shortcuts
- Learn your boat and the Hydro Jump

There's certainly a noticeable nuance to these games when you catch on those secret-at-plain-sight strats, most notably with the first two games due to the Hydro Jump not being mapped to a single button, but as I go through each of those three points, I'll mention what H2Overdrive adds or change to these instructions, whether big or small.

###    Boosters are mapped.
---
Boosters in all three games are in blue and red variety, blue pickups giving you a few seconds of boost while the red pickups give you double of that. So that is easy enough to understand...until you have to start deciding between paths that might have different pickups, or more commonly later on, get distracted by shiny booster pickups that are way above the water you are racing on if you don't know the Hydro Jump.

While explaining how the boosters you choose to pick can influence the lines you take on the race [beyond the fact that if you are clearly aiming at one and miss it, you're screwed], there's a THIRD booster pickup exclusive to H2Overdrive: The **Super Boost**.

Visible aThis is a yellow pickup, either at plain sight in an alternate path or hiding behind a well-timed jump or shortcut, these don't add more seconds to you that temporarily grants access to a Super bBoost gauge, but instead temporarily grants you a superpowered boost that will last as long as you don't use it up entirely.

...Except that the Super Boost gauge usually until you deplete it. 

It depletes **way** faster than a full Boost Gauge despite looking the game, can only be refueled with another Super Boost pickup, and once you use it up, you're back to the normal boost, although.

The upside is that any normal boost you had before you'll keep the boost gauge you had before the pickup [as well as still get normal boost stored if you grab normal pickups while you have the Super Boost active].

However, there's a very good reason for the Super Boost to be rare and much faster to waste if reckless. The boost itself is very fast-acting and goes faster than the normal boost, obviously...but its when you use it mid-air when you notice how broken it can be.

A quirk that's kept from the original is that any speed you gained before going mid-air, or are gaining mid-air through boosters, will stay stored until you land or hit something on the way down. It's one reason why it can be effective to boost into a jump, then as long as a straight allows you to, keep chaining jumps to keep that speed while wasting less boost than just holding it down the whole straight.

So if you use the Super Boost briefly mid-air, you can save on the boost itself while *gaining its speed increase for way longer as long as you are mid-air.* 

There's a track in this game named Temple of Flume that has a chance for an easy Super Boost pickup, and later on, a less easy but still not too difficult chance to pick ANOTHER one...and in both cases you're going into long straights with enough vertical space to jump.
